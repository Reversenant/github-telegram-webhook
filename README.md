# github-telegram-webhook
Webhook to receive events from GitHub

## How to run
1. Rename `.env.example` and provide required environment variables
2. Rename `templates.example` according to `TEMPLATES_PATH` environment variable
3. Provide code to Yandex Cloud Cloud Function (handler - `main.ya_handler`) or create your own one deploy with public URL.
4. Set up webhook in your repository. Choose events carefully. 

## Message templates
Messages templates -- pure Jinja2 templates for creating message to Telegram. Every template is targeted to one of webhook events (`x-github-event` header) with number of actions. 
`templates.example` is generated by `generate_templates.py`, list of events provided by [official webhook specification](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks) 

## Tips and tricks
1. Filter sending events. `x-github-event` can be filtered by GitHub Webhook settings. Each action of event can be filtered by remove `if` statement for this action in specified event template.
